    "# Assignment 1: Introduction to histopathology image analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to define and analyze the problem that you will be working on. In the main project, you will develop a deep neural network model that can identify metastases in image patches from histological preparations of lymph node tissue from breast cancer patients. Then, you will submit results of the developed model to an open compentition where it will be compared to models developed by other researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following three subsections give an introduction to deep learning, medical image analysis challenges/competitions, and detection of lymph node metastases. This very brief text along with the provided references are a good starting point for further exploration these topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep learning for medical image analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming decade, artificial intelligence will affect many aspects of human life and society ranging from home automation and self-driving cars to algorithmic detection of “fake news” on social media. This technology will also inevitably influence healthcare and in turn medical imaging. One of the most active fields of research in artificial intelligence is deep machine learning [1][2]. This concept works by learning abstract, hierarchical feature representations of input data that are predictive of a certain target (e.g. a class label in the case of classification). In contrast to classical machine learning methods, deep learning eliminates the step of “manual” feature engineering that is a tedious process and sub-optimal compared with learned representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of medical image analysis, the use of deep learning methods has already resulted in notable progress for a variety of tasks. Some of the first applications where automatic methods were shown to outperform medical experts have been in histopathology image analysis [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medical image analysis challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the developments that brought about the success of deep learning methods in computer vision was the availability of large, public annotated image datasets. In medical image analysis, this was mirrored in the form of medical image analysis challenges – friendly competitions in which researchers worldwide evaluate their solutions on the same data with the same criteria, in a blinded manner [4]. Organizing a challenge constitutes collecting and publicly distributing a training dataset that can be used to address a specific clinical task (such as detection of lymph node metastases). The ground truth for the testing is set is retained by the organizers of the challenge, which facilitates fair and independent evaluation and comparison of methods. The organization of medical image analysis challenges has had a tremendous impact on the advancement of the state of the art in the field. In the coming decade, such methods will continue to push the field forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the main project work, you will use a dataset of image patches [9] derived from the CAMELYON16 challenge [3]. This Patch-CAMELYON dataset is itself published as a challenge on the Kaggle platform [10]. You will submit the results of your project work to this platform for independent evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other examples of histopathology image analysis challenges organized by our group are AMIDA13 [5] and TUPAC16 [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection of lymph node metastases\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of metastases in sentinel axillary lymph nodes is an important component of breast cancer staging [7]. This is evaluated by examination of histological preparations of lymph node tissue by pathologists. Although manual assessment by a pathologists is the current standard practice, this procedure is notoriousely tedious to perform and can result in missed metastases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The move towards digitalization of histopathology labs with the introduction of whole-slide image scanners [8], has opened the possibility of automating some of the tasks performed by pathologists with the use of image analysis methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Setting up the working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you are free to use a programming language and environment of your own choice for the main project work, the examples in the assignments are in Python. If you need to refresh your Python programming skills, we recommend the following educational modules that we have prepared: https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python essentials module describes how to install the Anaconda Python distribution. The neural network examples in the assignments use the Keras neural networks API. We recommend installing Keras with Tensorflow as the underlying framework. Instructions on how to install the Tensorflow and Keras Python packages can be found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install, https://keras.io/#installation, but is should be as simple as typing the following commands in your command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install tensorflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install keras`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you have a GPU that is supported by Tensorflow, you should install the Tensorflow GPU package instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install tensorflow-gpu`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will move the training of the neural networks to the GPU, which is much faster than on the CPU. \n",
